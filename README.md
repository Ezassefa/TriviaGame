HW Assignment 5

The main two problems I had were having the pages load when I wanted them. I did not want Times Up to always 
be on the page but it was and was unable to find a way to rememdy that. Other than that I also had a problem 
with the submit button. I could never get the functionality of it to work. However if you wait for the 30 seconds
to expire the correct and incorrect answers to pop up. Just not how I wanted it too.
